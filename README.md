# Neo4j Cypher Props

## Using the Package

You can install your package in any Node.js project using npm:

```bash
npm install neo4j-cypher-props
```

And use the Rust functions in your JavaScript code:

```bash
import {greet} from 'neo4j-cypher-props';

console.log(greet('World'));
```

This is a basic example to get started. I will add soon more complex interactions between Rust and JavaScript for Neo4j Cypher queries.
